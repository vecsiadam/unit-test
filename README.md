# unit-test
 
 ## Write a program in any programming language that works as described here: Implement a method that gets a delimited string as input and returns the sum of the values.

* An empty string returns zero 
* A single number returns the value 
* Two numbers, comma delimited, returns the sum 
* Two numbers, newline delimited, returns the sum
* Three numbers, delimited either way, returns the sum
* Negative numbers are ignored 
* Numbers greater than 1000 are ignored 
* A single char delimiter can be defined on the first line (e.g. # for a ‘#’ as the delimiter) 
* A multi char delimiter can be defined on the first line (e.g. [###] for ‘###’ as the delimiter) 
* Many single or multi-char delimiters can be defined (each wrapped in square brackets) 
* Use a coding standard like Google Java Style Guide or Java Coding Standard by Oracle and implement unit test like junit test
